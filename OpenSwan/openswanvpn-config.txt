IPSEC Tunnel #1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This configuration assumes that you already have a default openswan installation in place on the Amazon Linux operating system (but may also work with other distros as well)

1) Open /etc/sysctl.conf and ensure that its values match the following:
   net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
   net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0
   net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

2) Apply the changes in step 1 by executing the command 'sysctl -p'

3) Open /etc/ipsec.conf and look for the line below. Ensure that the # in front of the line has been removed, then save and exit the file.
    #include /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

4) Create a new file at /etc/ipsec.d/aws.conf if doesn't already exist, and then open it. Append the following configuration to the end in the file:
 #leftsubnet= is the local network behind your openswan server, and you will need to replace the <LOCAL NETWORK> below with this value (don't include the brackets). If you have multiple subnets, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 instead.
 #rightsubnet= is the remote network on the other side of your VPN tunnel that you wish to have connectivity with, and you will need to replace <REMOTE NETWORK> with this value (don't include brackets).

5) Create a new file at /etc/ipsec.d/aws.secrets if it doesn't already exist, and append this line to the file (be mindful of the spacing!):

(OPTIONAL CONFIG) Tunnel Healthcheck and Failover
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Openswan does not provide a built-in tunnel failover functionality. However, there are some third-party workarounds to this.

=== DISCLAIMER ===
Please be aware that AWS is in no way responsible for any of the use, management, maintenance, or potential issues you may encounter with the third-party workarounds. It is strongly recommended that you thoroughly test any failover solution prior to implementing it into your production environment
